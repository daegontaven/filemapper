# File Mapping Module

"""
This module is designed to create variables for files that are to be accessed
collectively. Since files tend to take up a lot of memory, it is not advised to
use this module to keep multiple files in a directory open. The mapper works by
creating variables with same file name and maps them(Do not confuse this for
the built-in maps() function) to their file location. These variables can then
be accessed like regular files using read(). All the functions defined here
return a tuple of successfully processed files.
